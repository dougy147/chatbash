# Given a prompt and an instruction, the model will return an edited version of the prompt.

#  \"model\": \"${MODEL}\",
#  \"input\": \"${USER_PROMPT}\", # The input text to use as a starting point for the edit.
#  \"instruction\": \"${USER_INSTRUCTIONS}\", # The instruction that tells the model how to edit the prompt.
#  \"n\": \"${EDITS_NUMBER}\", # facultative : How many edits to generate for the input and instruction.
#  \"top_p\": \"${TOP_P}\", # facultative : An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
#  \"temperature\": \"${TEMPERATURE}\", # facultative : What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.
